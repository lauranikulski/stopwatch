# stopwatch

Codecademy meetup project 

https://community.codecademy.com/events/details/codecademy-seoul-presents-javascript-projects-for-beginners-community-showcase-45-mins/

You may find this meetup useful if: 

ðŸ‘¾ you're currently learning web dev (backend/frontend)

ðŸ‘¾ you'd like to get more hands-on with JavaScript but are finding it hard to get started

ðŸ‘¾ you'd like to get started with JS projects of your own, particularly if you'd like to go off platform 

ðŸ‘¾ you wish to connect with your fellow learners 





For this meetup, following introductions, we will start out by looking at a stopwatch project - inspiration gleaned from this YouTube video. 



Next, I would like to hear more from you, and I encourage you to tell us a little more about your own project - maybe even screen share, if you're comfortable. 

You may choose: 

ðŸ§¿ a project you completed on Codecademy 

ðŸ§¿ a project from freeCodeCamp 

ðŸ§¿ a project from Vanilla JavaScript Projects 

ðŸ§¿ ... or, choose your own!
